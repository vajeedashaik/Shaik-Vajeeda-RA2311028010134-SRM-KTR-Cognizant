Mapping Entities to Database Tables:
Use annotations like @Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue, etc.
Define one-to-many relationship between Department and Employee.
Exercise 3: Employee Management System - Creating Repositories
Business Scenario: 
Create repositories for Employee and Department entities to perform CRUD operations.
Instructions:
Overview of Spring Data Repositories:
Learn the benefits of using Spring Data repositories.
Creating Repositories:
Create EmployeeRepository and DepartmentRepository interfaces extending JpaRepository.
Define derived query methods in these repositories.
Exercise 4: Employee Management System - Implementing CRUD Operations
Business Scenario: 
Implement CRUD operations for managing employees and departments.
Instructions:
Basic CRUD Operations:
Use JpaRepository methods to create, read, update, and delete employees and departments.
Implement RESTful endpoints for these operations using EmployeeController and DepartmentController.
Exercise 5: Employee Management System - Defining Query Methods
Business Scenario: 
Enhance your repository to support custom queries.
Instructions:
Defining Query Methods:
Use keywords in method names to create custom query methods.
Implement custom query methods using the @Query annotation.
Named Queries:
Define and execute named queries with @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries.
Exercise 6: Employee Management System - Implementing Pagination and Sorting
Business Scenario: 
Add pagination and sorting capabilities to your employee search functionality.
Instructions:
Pagination:
Implement pagination for the employee list using Page and Pageable.
Sorting:
Add sorting functionality to your queries.
Combine pagination and sorting in your search endpoint.
Exercise 7: Employee Management System - Enabling Entity Auditing
Business Scenario: 
Implement auditing to track the creation and modification of employees and departments.
Instructions:
Entity Auditing:
Enable auditing in your application by configuring auditing properties.
Use annotations like @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy, @CreatedDate, and @LastModifiedDate.
Exercise 8: Employee Management System - Creating Projections
Business Scenario: 
Create projections to fetch specific data subsets from the employee and department entities.
Instructions:
Projections:
Define interface-based and class-based projections.
Use @Value and constructor expressions to control the fetched data.
Exercise 9: Employee Management System - Customizing Data Source Configuration
Business Scenario: 
Customize your data source configuration and manage multiple data sources.
Instructions:
Spring Boot Auto-Configuration:
Leverage Spring Boot auto-configuration for data sources.
Externalizing Configuration:
Externalize configuration with application.properties.
Manage multiple data sources within your application.
Exercise 10: Employee Management System - Hibernate-Specific Features
Business Scenario: 
Leverage Hibernate-specific features to enhance your application's performance and capabilities.
Instructions:
Hibernate-Specific Annotations:
Use Hibernate-specific annotations to customize entity mappings.
