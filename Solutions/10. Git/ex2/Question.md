Hands on 2
Write queries on stock table using Query Methods With one year stock data of Facebook, Google and Netflix, we need to implement Spring Data JPA Query Methods for the following scenarios:Sample DataSample data for implementing this hands on is provided to you in the platform
Setup stock data
Create a new table for storing stock details.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `ormlearn`.`stock` (
  `st_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `st_code` varchar(10), 
  `st_date` date,
  `st_open` numeric(10,2),
  `st_close` numeric(10,2), 
  `st_volume` numeric,
  PRIMARY KEY (`st_id`)
);
The file stock-data.csv in spring-data-jpa-files folder contains the stock data of Facebook, Google and Netflix from 18 Oct 2018 to 17 Oct 2019. This is public data downloaded from finance.yahoo.com.
Open stock-data.csv file in Excel
Include the following formula in F2 cell, this will display the insert script in F2 cell.
=CONCATENATE("insert into stock (st_code, st_date, st_open, st_close, st_volume) values (""", B2, """, """, YEAR(A2), "-", MONTH(A2), "-", DAY(A2), """, ", C2, ", ", D2, ", ", E2, ");")
Drag the formula for all the rows of data in F column.
Copy all data in F column and paste it in Notepad or Notepad++ and save it as a file named stock-data.sql. Execute this script in mysql command line client which populates data into ormlearn.stock table. Following command assumes that the git project is available in D:.
mysql&gt; source D:\spring-data-jpa-files\stock-data.sql
Create new class Stock in orm-learn project and define the required mapping annotations.
Create StockRepository class to write the Query Methods
Create methods in OrmLearnApplication to test by autowiring StockRepository directly.

Hands on 3
Create payroll tables and bean mapping To demonstrate one to many, many to one and many to many relationships in Hibernate, a schema with entities employee, department and skill will be used. In this hands on we will setup the tables and data, which forms the basis for learning the mappings in Hibernate.Schema StructureFollow steps below to create necessary tables:
Open mysql client in command line
Use the source command to execute the payroll.sql script file available in spring-data-jpa-files folder. The following command assumes that spring-data-jpa-files folder is in D:.
 mysql&gt; source D:\spring-data-jpa-files\payroll.sql
Define bean mapping
Open orm-learn project in Eclipse
Create model classes Employee, Department and Skill in com.cognizant.orm-learn.model package
Define each model should have @Entity and @Table annotations.
Each id field should be have @Id annotation and @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) annotation. @GeneratedValue annotation ensures auto increment of id creation.
Define @Column against each field.
Define getters, setters and toString() methods
Employee
private int id;
private String name;
private double salary;
private boolean permanent;
private Date dateOfBirth;
Department
private int id;
private String name;
Skill
private int id;
private String name;
Create appropriate repository interfaces EmployeeRepository, DepartmentRepository and SkillRepository in repository package
Hands on 4
Implement many to one relationship between Employee and Department Follow steps below to defined many to one relationship and perform persistence operations:Preparation of Service Classes
Create EmployeeService, DepartmentService and SkillService defined with annotation @Service. In each of this class autowire respective repository.
In each of the service class implement two methods one is to get the entity based on id and the other one is to save the entity. Sample code below provided for EmployeeService, in similar fashion include the methods for DepartmentService and SkillService.
EmployeeService - get() method
    @Transactional
    public Employee get(int id) {
        LOGGER.info("Start");
        return employeeRepository.findById(id).get();
    }
EmployeeService - save() method
    @Transactional
    public void save(Employee employee) {
        LOGGER.info("Start");
        employeeRepository.save(employee);
        LOGGER.info("End");
    }
Include static references of EmployeeService, DepartmentService and SkillService in OrmLearnApplication.
Assign employeeService, departmentService and skillService from the context in OrmLearnApplication main() method.
Implementation of @ManyToOne mapping
Define department in Employee bean with @ManyToOne and @JoinTable annotation. This defines the relationship between the entities.
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "em_dp_id")
    private Department department;
Include setters and getters for instance variable department.
Getting Employee along with Department
Create new method testGetEmployee() in OrmLearnApplication
Implement below code in the method.
    private static void testGetEmployee() {
        LOGGER.info("Start");
        Employee employee = employeeService.get(1);
        LOGGER.debug("Employee:{}", employee);
        LOGGER.debug("Department:{}", employee.getDepartment());
        LOGGER.info("End");
    }
The above implementation gets the employee with id 1 and displays the employee details and department details.
Include testGetEmployee() method in main and comment the other test method calls.
Execute the main method and observe the following:
In the logs check the lines where the query is generated.
Since the relationship is defined, hibernate fetches department data as well. The query should look something like the below. Observe the department table join in this query. The query is formatted for better readability.
select employee0_.em_id as em_id1_2_0_, employee0_.em_date_of_birth as em_date_2_2_0_, 
       employee0_.em_dp_id as em_dp_id6_2_0_, employee0_.em_name as em_name3_2_0_, 
       employee0_.em_permanent as em_perma4_2_0_, employee0_.em_salary as em_salar5_2_0_, 
       department1_.dp_id as dp_id1_1_1_, department1_.dp_name as dp_name2_1_1_ 
  from employee employee0_ left outer join department department1_ 
    on employee0_.em_dp_id=department1_.dp_id 
 where employee0_.em_id=?
NOTE: SME to explain the learners about Eager Fetch and Lazy Fetch. As per JPA specification by default, Eager Fetch is applied For ManyToOne and OneToOne relationships. Hence department details as well is joined and fetched by Hibernate. Add Employee
Create new method testAddEmployee() in OrmLearnApplication and implement the following steps
Create a new instance of Employee
Set the values for the employee using setter method
Get a department based on department id 1 using departmentService
Set the department in employee based on the department obtained in the previous step
Invoke employeeService.save() passing the employee object created
Log employee object reference in debug mode
Include testAddEmployee() invocation in main() method and comment other test methods
Invoke the main method and check the following:
Log should contain select query to get the department and insert statement to add employee
Observe that the employee log after save contains the id. Hibernate inserts the records, gets the id and set the id instance variable of employee
Check in database if new employee data is inserted in employee table
Update Employee
Create new method testUpdateEmployee() in OrmLearnApplication and implement the following steps
Get an employee instance based on employee id using employeeService.get() method
Get a department based on department id using departmentService. Use a different department id from the one that is fetched.
Set the department in employee based on the department obtained in the previous step
Invoke employeeService.save() passing the employee object created
Log employee object reference in debug mode
Include testUpdateEmployee() invocation in main() method and comment other test methods
Invoke the main method and check the following:
Log should contain select query to get the department and employee. There should be update statement that updates employee table
Check in database if department id is modified.
Hands on 5
Implement one to many relationship between Employee and Department Department.java
Include new instance variable for set of employees and define the OneToMay annotation
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
    private Set&lt;Employee&gt; employeeList;
Include setter and getter for employeeList
OrmLearnApplication.java
Include new method testGetDepartment()
In this method, get a department using departmentService.get() passing the id. Select an department id that has more than one employee.
Log the returned department and department.getEmployeeList()
Include testGetDepartment() method invocation in main method and comment the other test methods.
Execute the main() method which will fail with LazyInitializationException. This is because the default fetch type for OneToMany relationship is LAZY, hibernate fetches only department details and does not get the employee details.
In order to get the employee list as well, modify the annotation to include the fetch type as EAGER. Make this change in employeeList annotation definition of Department class.
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department", fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private Set&lt;Employee&gt; employeeList;
After this change try executing the main() method, which will fetch both department and employee
Hands on 6
Implement many to many relationship between Employee and Skill Many to Many mapping defintion 
Include set of skill list in Employee.java with appropriate getter and setter
Include set of employee list in Skill.java with appropriate getter and setter
Include ManyToMany definition in Employee.java as specified below:
    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(name = "employee_skill",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "es_em_id"), 
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "es_sk_id"))
    private Set&lt;Skill&gt; skillList;
Include ManyToMany defintion in Skill.java as specified below:
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "skillList")
    private Set&lt;Employee&gt; employeeList;
Fetching Employee along with Skills
In testGetEmployee() method of OrmLearnApplication.java include a new line to log employee skill details after the department log.
        LOGGER.debug("Skills:{}", employee.getSkillList());
Execute the main method which will fail with LazyInitializationException
Include fetch type as eager in @ManyToMany annotation of Employee.java, which will fetch the skill details as well.
Add Skill to Employee
Include a new method testAddSkillToEmployee() in OrmLearnApplication.java
Implement the following steps in this method:
Identify an employee id and skill id for which a relationship does not exists
Get employee based on employee id calling employeeService.get() method
Get skill based on skill id calling skillService.get() method
Get the skill list from employee and add the skill obtained in the previous step to the skill list
Call save method in employeeService passing the employee reference
Invoke testAddSkillToEmployee() in main method and comment other test methods
Execute the main method and check employee_skill table to verify if the skill is added to the employee.
